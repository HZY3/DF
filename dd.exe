Data duplication refers to instances where the same data is stored in multiple locations or formats. 
This can occur intentionally, such as when creating backup copies of important data, or unintentionally, 
such as when data is accidentally copied or saved to multiple locations. While data duplication can provide 
redundancy and help ensure data availability, it can also make it more difficult to manage data and ensure its 
accuracy and consistency. In digital forensics, managing data duplication is important to maintain the integrity 
of evidence and prevent errors or inconsistencies during analysis.
